# Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] 1. Implement Image Conversion Service (TIFF to PNG)\n  - [ ] 1.1 Create a service to convert TIFF images to PNG format using the Pillow library. _Requirements: 1_\n  - [ ] 1.2 Implement error handling for invalid file format or corrupted image data during TIFF to PNG conversion. _Requirements: 1_\n  - [ ] 1.3 Implement logging for successful and failed TIFF to PNG conversions. _Requirements: 1, 7_\n- [ ] 2. Implement OCR Processing Service (PNG)\n  - [ ] 2.1 Create a service to extract text from PNG images using Paperless-ngx's built-in OCR capabilities. _Requirements: 2_\n  - [ ] 2.2 Configure the OCR service to use both Japanese and English languages. _Requirements: 2_\n  - [ ] 2.3 Implement error handling for unreadable text or recognition failures during OCR processing. _Requirements: 2_\n  - [ ] 2.4 Implement logging for successful and failed OCR operations. _Requirements: 2, 7_\n- [ ] 3. Implement Image Conversion Service (PNG to WebP)\n  - [ ] 3.1 Create a service to convert PNG images to WebP format using the Pillow library. _Requirements: 3_\n  - [ ] 3.2 Use appropriate compression settings and quality levels for WebP conversion. _Requirements: 3_\n  - [ ] 3.3 Implement error handling for potential exceptions during PNG to WebP conversion. _Requirements: 3_\n  - [ ] 3.4 Implement logging for successful and failed PNG to WebP conversions. _Requirements: 3, 7_\n- [ ] 4. Implement WebP Storage Service\n  - [ ] 4.1 Create a service to store WebP files in a structured directory. _Requirements: 4_\n  - [ ] 4.2 Implement a unique naming convention for the WebP files (e.g., using a unique ID). _Requirements: 4_\
  - [ ] 4.3 Ensure that the WebP files are stored securely and with appropriate permissions. _Requirements: 4, 6_\
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement logging for successful and failed file storage operations. _Requirements: 4, 7_\
- [ ] 5. Implement Paperless-ngx API Integration Service\n  - [ ] 5.1 Create a service to post the extracted data to the Paperless-ngx REST API. _Requirements: 5_\
  - [ ] 5.2 Use an API key for authentication when posting data to Paperless-ngx. _Requirements: 5_\
  - [ ] 5.3 Store the API key securely (e.g., as an environment variable). _Requirements: 5, 6_\
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement error handling for API responses and potential errors, such as invalid API key or server errors. _Requirements: 5, 8_\
  - [ ] 5.5 Implement logging for successful and failed API requests. _Requirements: 5, 7_\
- [ ] 6. Implement Security Considerations\n  - [ ] 6.1 Ensure that the Paperless-ngx API key is stored securely and is not hardcoded in the code. _Requirements: 6_\
  - [ ] 6.2 Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities. _Requirements: 6_\
- [ ] 7. Implement Logging\n  - [ ] 7.1 Implement logging for key events during the workflow for debugging and auditing. _Requirements: 7_\
  - [ ] 7.2 Ensure log messages include timestamps, event descriptions, and relevant data. _Requirements: 7_\
- [ ] 8. Implement Error Handling\n  - [ ] 8.1 Implement error handling for all services. _Requirements: 8_\
  - [ ] 8.2 Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages. _Requirements: 8_\
  - [ ] 8.3 Implement appropriate error recovery mechanisms. _Requirements: 8_\
- [ ] 9. Implement File Structure\n  - [ ] 9.1 Ensure the new components adhere to the project structure defined in `.kiro/steering/structure.md`. _Requirements: 10_\
